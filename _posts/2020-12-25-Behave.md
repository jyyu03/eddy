# Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst
> Robert Sapolsky

## Context
I have no prior knowledge on neurology, endocrinology, or evolution. I saw Dr. Robert Sapolsky's lectures on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNnIGh9g6fA&list=PLD7E21BF91F3F9683) and was very inspired by his way of speaking and the subject matter. I do owe some notice to my roommate who was a good sounding board for me to collect my thoughts. Certainly, this book should be recommended to people because of its positive utilitarian post-modern take on the prison-system and capitalist society writ large. If anything, a reshaping for our deteriorating school system.

I am planning on rereading the book at a later time, but I am currently reading Chapter 8 from which these notes will first germinate.
